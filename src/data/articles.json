    "content": "Long-term immigration is one of the most under-appreciated economic stabilizers in the U.S.\n\nGovernment and non-partisan research show that many long-term immigrants—especially those without full paperwork—contribute financially while under-utilizing public benefits. Undocumented immigrants alone pay an estimated $90–100B per year in federal, state, and local taxes, including tens of billions into Social Security and Medicare, programs they are largely ineligible to access (ITIN and payroll withholding data).\n\nAt the same time, they disproportionately work low-paying but essential jobs—construction, agriculture, hospitality, caregiving—that keep businesses operating and help suppress inflationary pressure on goods and services. The National Academies of Sciences has shown that immigrant labor lowers prices across multiple sectors by expanding labor supply where shortages are most acute.\n\nLike most economies throughout history, the U.S. has always had a shadow labor market. While imperfect, it has acted as a pressure valve—supporting output, moderating prices, and absorbing demographic and demand shocks.\n\nThe biggest payoff is intergenerational. Immigrants invest heavily in their children’s education and mobility. Long-run analyses cited by the Congressional Budget Office show that immigration expands the labor force, increases GDP, and improves fiscal outlooks over time as second-generation Americans become higher-earning, fully tax-paying contributors.\n\nIn short: immigration isn’t a short-term cost—it’s a deferred economic investment with compounding returns.",
